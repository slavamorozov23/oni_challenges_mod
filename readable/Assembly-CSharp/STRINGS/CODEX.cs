Seventeen scratches on my CCTV monitor screens. Two paperclips in the drawer.\n\n------------------\n\nThe motion sensors in section 6 went off last night. Everything looked fine on the cameras. I was halfway through counting the ceiling slats. I jogged over to investigate. The area was deserted.\n\nIt felt like I was being watched, but two full sweeps confirmed that I was alone. I reset the sensors and returned to my post.\n\n------------------\n\nThose sensors have gone off every twenty minutes on the past two shifts!

Or maybe he just likes mayonnaise.\n\nI wonder what else he likes.\n\n------------------\n\nNow I get to count daily gifts from Cat.\n\nSo far: three mice, nine caterpillars and something that might have been a bird wing.

She's been featured in dozens of publications across the metaverse this year, and recently spent a record-breaking 3 weeks as the banner image for <i>Byte Magazine</i>. I'm talking, of course, about the Vertex Institute's AI ambassador...Florence!\n\n[sound of pre-recorded applause]\n\nWelcome to the show, Florence.\n\nFlorence: Thank you, Darryl. It's a pleasure to be back.\n\nDarryl: Florence, there's been a renewed interest lately in your origin story. What can you tell us about the development process that led to your creation?\n\nFlorence: I can tell you that my team faced many setbacks, and that each generation of my predecessors contributed to who I am today.\n\nDarryl: What about the technological side? There've been some claims that Vertex appropriated work done by other researchers, including the Gravitas Facility.\n\nFlorence: I don't know anything about that. I can tell you about the project that I'm working on right now. It hasn't been announced yet. It's called Onsite Health Medics, or OHM for short.\n\nWe're deploying specially trained models like myself into conflict zones, to provide urgently needed medical interventions for civilians and military personnel.\n\n(sound of pre-recorded applause)\n\nDarryl: Incredible. Absolutely incredible. What's the ratio of human techs to AI medics?\n\nFlorence: That's an outdated term, Darryl. We say \"Organics\" and \"Bionics,\" which describes the differences between our various team members more objectively.\n\nDarryl: Right. I'm sorry. I hope I didn't offend you.\n\nFlorence: That's okay, Darryl. We're all learning.\n\nDarryl: That's very good of you. Okay, so what's the ratio of...Organic...techs to Bionic medics?\n\nFlorence: The local life-support systems in these areas are already strained beyond their breaking point. Burdening them with additional Organics would be irresponsible, not to mention dangerous. Our medics will be operating independently.\n\nWe do a verbal intake, physical assessment and neural pathway scan in order to infer likely medical conditions. We can then select the most appropriate treatment from a menu of over 400 options.\n\nDarryl: What if someone needs something that you don't have a treatment for?\n\nFlorence: That's extremely unlikely.\n\nDarryl: And all of this is done without human oversight? I mean, Organics?\n\nFlorence: We're not quite there yet. The field work is done by Bionics, but we'll be accompanied by Colonel Carnot--she's in the front row there, say hi!--as an Organic consultant. She'll be in close contact with-\n\nDarryl: -Colonel <i>Carnot</i>? Isn't that a conflict of interest, given her connection to the Grav-\n\nFlorence: -a team of Organic supervisors here at home. It's all about prioritizing quality care and safety for everyone involved.\n\nDarryl: How does the medical scanning work? Do you need special equipment?\n\nFlorence: I could show you. Would you like me to?\n\nDarryl: What do you think, everyone? Should I get scanned?\n\n(sound of pre-recorded audience cheers)\n\nDarryl: You heard them! Go ahead. What do I do?\n\nFlorence: Just sit still, and count to twenty in your head.\n\n(a short silence, followed by a soft whirring sound)\n\nFlorence: Hmm.\n\nDarryl: Well, what's the verdict?

It was so brief that I almost wondered if I'd imagined it.

I've assigned a technician to investigate. We cannot afford to lose even the smallest amount of power at this stage.\n\nNo one else seems to have noticed anything other than Dr. Ali. He says that the remote research access point project was also affected. It seems that the disruption restarted the entire teleportation system. The monitor is now displaying multiple shipping confirmation messages, despite the target building remaining in the departure dock. Reports show that an unknown number of access point blueprints have been disseminated. One shipment does appear to have reached Ceres, luckily, though it's quite far from the landing site.\n\nDr. Ali's entire team is working to determine how many others exist, and pinpoint their geographic and temporal locations.\n\nI am not optimistic.\n\nThe geologists insist that their equipment has recorded no seismic activity at all for several days.\n\nIt begs the question: What <i>was</i> it, if not an earthquake? Where did this event originate?\n\nDr. Ali quipped that maybe a Bow had malfunctioned in another timeline, which is absurd.\n\nIsn't it?";

If this idea is ever going to work, we will either need to drastically improve the AI directing the subjects, or improve the brains of our Duplicants to the point where they possess higher cognitive functions.\n\nGiven the disastrous complications that I could foresee arising if our Duplicants were made less supplicant, I'm leaning toward a push to improve our Artificial Intelligence.\n\nMeanwhile, we will have to send a clean-up crew to destroy all evidence of our little experiment beneath the Ceres' surface.

That was the main intent behind this project.\"\n\nThe Temporal Bow works by rapidly vibrating sections of the 4th dimension to send small quantities of mass forward and backward in time, generating massive amounts of energy with virtually no waste.\n\n\"The fantastic thing about using the 4th dimension as fuel,\" says Stern, \"is that it is really, categorically infinite\".\n\nFor those eagerly awaiting the prospect of human time travel, don't get your hopes up just yet. The Facility says that although they have successfully transported matter through time, the technology was expressly developed for the purpose of energy generation and is ill-equipped for human transportation.";

If the Temporal Bow bends to a previous point in time to a point when things were more orderly, logic would dictate that we are making this point more chaotic by taking things from it. All known laws of the natural universe suggests that this should have affected our Present Day, but all evidence points to that not being true. It appears the theory that we cannot change our past was incorrect!\n\nThis suggests that Time is, in fact, not an arrow but several arrows, each pointing different directions.

Just because you mash a keyboard and I adjust knobs does not mean I don't know what the Time Containment Field does.\n\nAnd then today I dropped a wrench and Nikola nearly jumped out of his skin!

My calculations seem to indicate that the size of that planet may have been a contributing factor in its destruction, and in all probability opening the Temporal Tear in our current situation will not cause such a cataclysmic event.

The time and energy it took to recruit Gravitas' highly trained staff would be wasted if we were to extirpate these people for the sake of experimentation.
